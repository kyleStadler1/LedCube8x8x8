# LedCube 8x8x8

## Overview

The **LedCube 8x8x8** project utilizes 8x 8-bit shift registers to control horizontal slices of an LED cube. An additional 9th shift register manages each vertical layer. Strobing each horizontal layer creates a complete 3D animation effect. The PCB for this project was made using an Arduino Nano, 74xx series parts, solid-core copper wire for custom traces, and a grid style pcb board.

## Features

Current animations include:
- **Rain**: Simulates falling droplets.
- **Falling Planes**: Creates the effect of a flat plane pivoting down from 90 to 0 degrees on each side.
- **Center Pulsing Cube**: A pulsing effect originating from the center of the cube.
- **Corner Pulsing Cube**: Pulsing effects from each corner of the cube, one after the other.
- **Intersecting Planes**: Visuals of intersecting planes within the cube.
